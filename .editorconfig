# This file exists to help maintain consistent formatting
# throughout this project.
#
# These rules ONLY apply to files that will be edited by an actual editor,
# NOT to auto-generated files (i.e., *.lock files, etc.).
#
# Additionally, these rules ONLY apply to:
# a) new files, or
# b) your changes to existing files
#
# They will NOT automatically be applied to existing lines in a file
# (i.e., not all whitespace will be automatically removed from existing lines
# in a file). This is the job of CI and other various tools.
# This file just ensures that, when your editor makes changes to a file, those
# changes follow these rules.
#
# For an overview of each rule and its intended use and effect, see:
# http://editorconfig.org
